  objective: "To build a taxonomy for categories of spreadsheets from the ground up using Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",

  RQ: "What kinds of underlying themes and topics are present in spreadsheets created by end users?\n",
  
  naeem_summary: "Naeem et al. (2023) present a systematic thematic analysis method designed to enhance rigor and transparency in qualitative research by structuring each stage of analysis with 'R' criteria. Their approach involves six main steps, beginning with preparing transcripts and familiarizing themselves with the data, followed by selecting keywords using the 6 Rs (realness, richness, repetition, rationale, repartee, and regal), which ensure that key terms are meaningful, rich, and conceptually important. The next stage is coding, governed by the 6 Rs of coding (robust, reflective, resplendent, relevant, radical, and righteous), which focus on creating interpretative, powerful, distinct, and logically aligned codes that directly relate to the research question. Afterwards, the codes are synthesized into themes using the 4 Rs of theme development (reciprocal, recognizable, responsive, and resourceful), ensuring themes are cohesive, identifiable, aligned with research aims, and insightful. This systematic approach formalizes the thematic analysis process, making qualitative research more transparent, replicable, and conceptually robust, thus offering clear methodological guidance for constructing well-founded conceptual frameworks from qualitative data.\n",
  methodology: "In this research, we collect a dataset of diverse spreadsheet workbooks created by end users from the internet across different domains and contexts. Following this, we extract all of the data from the spreadsheet using python libraries and store it in a structured JSON format for you to analyse. Whle this transformation loses some of the visual and stylistic aspects of the data, it attempts to capture all the information from the spreadsheet that is relevant to understanding the purpose of the spreadsheet and the context in which it was created.\n",

  theoretical_underpinning: "The research is grounded in an adapted form of Grounded Theory, utilizing the capabilities of Large Language Models for systematic qualitative data analysis. It adopts a constructivist perspective, acknowledging that the resulting taxonomy is constructed through the interpretative process of the analysis.\n",
  
  theoretical_framework: "The study operates within a framework of structured thematic analysis, leveraging the 6 Rs framework (Realness, Richness, Repetition, Rationale, Repartee, Regal) for keyword selection and coding to ensure a rigorous and systematic development of the spreadsheet taxonomy.\n",

  data_type: "The primary data consists of the structural and content-based information extracted from a diverse set of spreadsheet workbooks, represented in a structured JSON format.\n"
